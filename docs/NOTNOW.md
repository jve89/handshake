# NOTNOW.md

This document captures all ideas, features, or edge cases we won’t include in v0.1 — either because they add complexity, aren't critical, or are better suited for a future version.

---

## 🔁 Edge Cases to Handle Later

* Editing or updating a submission after it's been sent  
* Deadline reminders or countdown emails  
* Revoke / reshare functionality after initial send  
* Editing a handshake after it’s shared  
* Preview mode for sender  
* File type restrictions / virus scanning  

> ✅ Re-upload is supported before submission — no edits allowed afterward

## 🛑 Excluded From MVP

* Payment integration (for now — Stripe later)  
* Signature collection (optional for later)  
* Public template gallery  
* Analytics beyond viewed/completed  
* Multi-language support  
* Team roles / multi-user dashboard  
* Custom branding / theming  
* Mobile app

---

## 🗂 Potential But Out-of-Scope

* AI auto-fill forms or validate uploaded content  
* OAuth integrations (Google, LinkedIn)  
* Webhooks and API access  
* Blockchain proofs / notarization  
* Smart contracts  
* PDF generation of the full handshake

---

## ✅ Already Promoted for v0.2+

* Inbox view for receivers who choose to log in  
  - If a recipient logs in before or after submitting a handshake, it will be added to their personal dashboard  
  - Enables optional 2-way interaction while remaining fully usable for anonymous 1-way handshakes
