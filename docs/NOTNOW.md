# NOTNOW.md

This document captures all ideas, features, or edge cases we won’t include in v0.1 — either because they add complexity, aren't critical, or are better suited for a future version.

## 🔁 Edge Cases to Handle Later

* Editing or updating a submission after it's been sent  
* Deadline reminders or countdown emails  
* Revoke / reshare functionality after initial send  
* Editing a handshake after it’s shared  
* Preview mode for sender  
* File type restrictions / virus scanning  

> ✅ Re-upload is supported before submission — no edits allowed afterward
