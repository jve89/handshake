# RISKS.md

## Overview

This document identifies known risks that could impact the Handshake project and outlines mitigation strategies.

---

## Technical Risks

- **Ephemeral filesystem on Heroku**  
  *Uploads stored locally will be lost on dyno restart.*  
  _Mitigation_: Implement S3 or other persistent storage for production.

- **Scaling database connections**  
  _Mitigation_: Monitor connection pool and optimize queries; consider read replicas if needed.

- **Third-party dependencies**  
  _Mitigation_: Minimize dependencies; keep up-to-date with security patches.

---

## Product Risks

- **Scope creep and feature bloat**  
  _Mitigation_: Strict adherence to NOTNOW.md and SCOPE.md.

- **User adoption and feedback lag**  
  _Mitigation_: Early user testing, rapid iteration cycles.

---

## Security Risks

- **File upload vulnerabilities (e.g., virus, malicious files)**  
  _Mitigation_: Implement file type restrictions and virus scanning in future releases.

- **Unauthorized access to submissions**  
  _Mitigation_: Enforce access control and authentication as the project evolves.

---

## Operational Risks

- **CI/CD pipeline failures**  
  _Mitigation_: Build automated tests and monitors early.

- **Infrastructure downtime**  
  _Mitigation_: Use reliable cloud providers and backups.
