# RISKS.md

## Overview

This document identifies known risks that could impact the Handshake project and outlines mitigation strategies.

---

## Technical Risks

- **Ephemeral filesystem on Heroku**  
  *Uploads stored locally will be lost on dyno restart.*  
  _Mitigation_: Implement S3 or other persistent storage for production environments as soon as feasible.

- **Scaling database connections**  
  _Mitigation_: Monitor connection pool usage and optimize queries; plan for read replicas or managed DB scaling if needed.

- **Third-party dependencies and breaking changes**  
  _Mitigation_: Minimize dependencies; maintain regular updates; pin versions and audit security patches frequently.

- **ES module quirks and environment inconsistencies**  
  _Mitigation_: Strict code review and testing in dev environments; standardized tooling and config files.

---

## Product Risks

- **Scope creep and feature bloat**  
  _Mitigation_: Strict adherence to NOTNOW.md and SCOPE.md; prioritize MVP delivery and iterative improvement.

- **User adoption and feedback lag**  
  _Mitigation_: Engage early testers; rapid iteration cycles; gather qualitative and quantitative feedback continuously.

- **UX complexity for sender interface**  
  _Mitigation_: Invest in clear UI/UX design; user testing for form composition workflow.

---

## Security Risks

- **File upload vulnerabilities (e.g., virus, malicious files)**  
  _Mitigation_: Plan and implement file type restrictions, virus scanning, and secure storage in future releases.

- **Unauthorized access to submissions or data leaks**  
  _Mitigation_: Enforce robust authentication and authorization as system scales; audit access logs regularly.

- **Data privacy and compliance**  
  _Mitigation_: Adopt GDPR and other relevant compliance measures early; keep user data minimization in mind.

---

## Operational Risks

- **CI/CD pipeline failures or flaky tests**  
  _Mitigation_: Build automated tests and monitoring early; adopt best practices for deployment pipelines.

- **Infrastructure downtime or outages**  
  _Mitigation_: Use reliable cloud providers; implement backups and recovery plans; monitor uptime proactively.
