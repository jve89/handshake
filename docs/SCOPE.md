- Public-facing handshake page accessible via unique URLs  
- Dynamic handshake form composition with unlimited fields and types configurable by sender  
- Support for file uploads, text inputs, and dropdown/select fields  
- Storage of submissions and responses in PostgreSQL  
- Simple, clean UI focused on ease of use, clarity, and mobile responsiveness  
- No-login, no-app-required receiver experience
