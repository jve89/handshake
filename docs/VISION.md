## 🌐 What is Handshake Really?

Handshake is a universal intake and interaction layer between two parties. It can be used for:

* File requests  
* Form collection  
* Payments (later)  
* Confirmations  
* Agreements (eventually, e-signatures)

**The goal**: replace chaotic email threads and disconnected uploads with one clean, branded, structured request flow.

Senders have full freedom to design handshakes with any number and combination of fields (text, file, select, email, etc.), enabling tailored intake flows.

## 🔭 Long-Term Opportunities

* Handshake Templates Store (HR, Legal, Freelance, Events)  
* Inbox support for receivers with accounts (optional login = 2-way access)  
* Paid Tiers (storage, branding, analytics, API access)  
* E-signatures (NDAs, contracts)  
* Smart Contracts (experimental use cases)  
* Cross-border Payment Modules  
* Language Localization  
* Mobile Experience (PWA and native apps planned)  
* Zapier / Make / Integromat integrations  
* AI: auto-validate uploads, pre-fill forms, detect missing info  
* Scalable, cloud-based file storage (S3 or similar)

## 💡 Core Principles

* Always sender-first (the one requesting controls the flow)  
* Designed to work without an app — just a link  
* No login required for receivers, but optional accounts unlock extra features (like inbox tracking)  
* Simple, beautiful, distraction-free experience for receivers  
* Zero chaos for the sender (track what’s done, what’s not)  
* Iterative roadmap: focus on a stable MVP, then expand features based on feedback  
* Flexible, dynamic handshake composition with unlimited fields  
* Secure file handling with local dev storage and planned production cloud storage  
* Mobile-first responsive design with smooth path to PWA and native apps

## ❌ What We Won’t Do

* Become a full CRM or task manager  
* Require logins from receivers  
* Force install of any mobile app  
* Lock core features behind early paywalls

## 📌 Competitive Edge

Handshake stands apart by offering a frictionless, branded, and structured intake experience that empowers senders with maximum flexibility while providing receivers a zero-barrier, no-login-needed process — unlike generic form builders or file sharing tools.
