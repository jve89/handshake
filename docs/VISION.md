## 🌐 What is Handshake Really?

Handshake is a universal intake and interaction layer between two parties. It can be used for:

* File requests  
* Form collection  
* Payments (later)  
* Confirmations  
* Agreements (eventually, e-signatures)

**The goal**: replace chaotic email threads and disconnected uploads with one clean, branded, structured request flow.

## 🔭 Long-Term Opportunities

* Handshake Templates Store (HR, Legal, Freelance, Events)  
* Paid Tiers (storage, branding, analytics, API access)  
* E-signatures (NDAs, contracts)  
* Smart Contracts (experimental use cases)  
* Cross-border Payment Modules  
* Language Localization  
* Mobile Experience  
* Zapier / Make / Integromat integrations  
* AI: auto-validate uploads, pre-fill forms, detect missing info

---

## 💡 Core Principles

* Always sender-first (the one requesting controls the flow)  
* Designed to work without an app — just a link  
* Simple, beautiful, distraction-free experience for receiver  
* Zero chaos for the sender (track what’s done, what’s not)

---

## ❌ What We Won’t Do

* Become a full CRM or task manager  
* Require logins from receivers  
* Force install of any mobile app  
* Lock core features behind early paywalls
